# A photoshop function?

## Synopsis

- When I started working on this workshop task, my goal was to create something interactive; however, my idea was initially unclear. I’ve felt a bit cloudy this week and believe that my lack of creativity stems from trying to learn too much too quickly. 

- After clarifying my thoughts, I decided to use one of my drawings and create layers in Photoshop. The idea was allowing the viewer to engage with the artwork by choosing their own layers. 

- I also thought about implementing a way for them to change the colors.
Additionally, my intention with my art has always been to capture emotions and modify them.

## Summary/Problem-solving

- As usual, I began by following the examples from our lecture.

- This time, the goal was to capture the same code and tweak it to express what I wanted for my task.

- I first watched our lecture video at

- https://canvas.auckland.ac.nz/courses/121821/pages/week-1-overview?module_item_id=2435967.

- I spent a significant amount of time trying to get the layers to work, but they seemed to disappear every time I added another one.

- To be honest, after several hours, I became frustrated because the layers kept disappearing. 

- I thought the issue might be the size of my pictures, so I used the code to resize them, but that wasn't the problem. 

- After a long struggle, I decided to ask our lecturer for help. In the end, we concluded that the transparency settings in my painting were causing the issues again.

- The solution was quite strange: I had to set the complete transparency value for one image, while the others needed to have different values.

- I still don't understand why, but it worked. I think it might be related to the files themselves.

- Once I resolved the layer issues, I continued following the lecture video example. 

- Next, I needed to implement sliders to modify colours. I realized that changing colours would require creating a function to modify pixels, and at this stage, I wanted to avoid the same issues I encountered in the last exercise. 

- Therefore, I decided instead to focus on allowing users to control the transparency of the image. 

- The challenge began when I realized that changing the transparency wasn't as easy as I had hoped, as my images had trouble with that. 

- After a long day of trying lecture samples and conducting trials, I finally got it to work.

- The last thing I wanted to add was an important question: How do you feel? I followed the video sample and implemented that as well.


## Future development

- I am eager to learn how to control color values using a slider. 

- I am also keen to understand how to move pixels and transform them into something meaningful.

- I want to be able to store the data and create a database that will allow me to influence people's emotions through my paintings.

## Conclusion:


- I just realized that I created a Photoshop function.

- It is a basic task, but in the end, it provides a good foundation to approach the bigger picture later on.
